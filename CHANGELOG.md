## [Unreleased]

### Phase 0 — end-to-end skeleton (Stages 0 + 1)

#### Added
- Monorepo foundation: `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `docker-compose.yml`
  (Postgres + Redis), GitHub Actions CI (lint + typecheck + test for both the
  Go and Node toolchains, plus an eval F1 gate).
- **Stage 0 — edge (Go, `services/edge`)**: GitHub App webhook receiver.
  Constant-time HMAC-SHA256 verification (fail-closed); strict normalization of
  `pull_request` payloads to a canonical `ReviewJob`; idempotency dedupe keyed on
  (repo, PR, action, head SHA); enqueue-then-ACK with a ~1ms 202 response
  (<100ms budget); `queue.Producer` port with an in-memory fake and a Redis
  Streams (`XADD`) implementation over a **zero-dependency, stdlib-only RESP
  client** (air-gapped buildable); structured JSON logs with secret redaction;
  graceful shutdown.
- **Gateway (`packages/gateway`)**: single LLM chokepoint. `LLMProvider` port
  with a fetch-based `AnthropicProvider` (no SDK) and a deterministic
  `FakeProvider`; **per-org BYOK** key resolution (key never logged, only a
  sha256 fingerprint); per-request **token + USD cost ledger** with a
  configurable pricing table (Stage 13 cost accounting).
- **Shared core (`packages/core`)**: canonical `ReviewJob` (+ validation),
  `Finding`/`ReviewResult` types, and a dependency-free unified-diff parser with
  commentable-line extraction.
- **Stage 1 — orchestrator (`services/orchestrator`)**: durable review workflow.
  `WorkflowEngine` port (InlineEngine with retry/backoff + lazy BullMqEngine,
  Temporal-swappable); `GitHubClient` port (REST + capturing fake); single-model
  `Reviewer` through the BYOK gateway with a robust JSON finding parser; poster
  that anchors findings to diff lines, renders GitHub `suggestion` blocks, and
  buckets a summary by severity; Stage 0→1 bridge consuming the Redis Stream via
  a consumer group (poison-ack / unacked-on-failure semantics) over a stdlib TS
  RESP client; `main.ts` production wiring and a `demo` that posts a full review
  in ~2ms.
- **Eval (`eval/`)**: precision/recall/F1/false-positive-rate harness with
  location-based matching, 10 gold-labeled seed PRs (real diffs), fixture +
  live modes, a results table, and a CI F1 regression gate.

#### Verified (acceptance gate)
- PR → posted review: `npm run demo` posts a 2-comment review (with a one-click
  fix) in ~2ms (budget 60s), exercised end-to-end through the stream bridge in
  the e2e test.
- Eval prints precision/recall/F1 on the seed set: **F1 81.8%, FPR 18.2%**.
- BYOK: swapping an org's key changes the billed key fingerprint (gateway test
  `BYOK: swapping an org's key changes which key is billed`).
- Tests: `go test ./...` (edge) and `npm test` (38 TS tests) green;
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `CHANGELOG.md` accurate.
